ANONYMOUS VOTING SYSTEM
ANDROID APPLICATION & ADMINISTRATION COMPUTER PROGRAM


The system designed to make the election process simple, pleasant and easy, to give access
to each and every person within the authorized group the ability to vote and make his choice
with minimal restrictions.
The main goal is to provide the user a fast and easy way to vote at any time and place, and
the administrator with the ability to easily manage the elections. Nowadays technology and
specifically our cellphones are irreplaceable part of our daily life, what can be more
accessible?
We convinced privacy and anonymity in any election should be the top priority, therefore
we implemented the system in such a way that we know the user voted but donâ€™t know who
he chose, additionally we applied encryption on the transferred information to ensure the
data is fully secured.
We truly believe technology is the next step that has to be taken to maintain and improve
our democracy.
